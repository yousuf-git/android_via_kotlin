## How It Works

1. The app uses the `assets` folder to store the `.txt` file.
2. If the file is already there, it reads content from that file otherwise creates a new one.
3. The content of the file is displayed in a `TextView` on the main screen.

## Project Structure

## Wanna see the txt file? 
Most people don't know where app's files are stored. But I got you covered !
1. Open Android Studio.
2. Go to `View` > `Tool Windows` > `Device File Explorer`.
3. Select your device or emulator.
4. Navigate to `data` > `data` > `com.learning.text_file_handling` > `files`.
5. You will find the `my_data_file.txt` file there.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
